# 🌍 GridFlex 360 – Interactive Renewable Grid Visualization

I decided to make my life both difficult but ideally slightly more interesting by building out an intereactive globe to illustrate the different stages of one aspect of the renewable energy transition - grid flexibility, with a focus on demand side repsonse. 

This project helps visualise the importance of distributed energy resources, such as using virtual power plants, EV charging stations, and other home-based assets.

Built with **globe.gl**, **Three.js**, and **Mapbox**, this project helps visualize the importance of **distributed energy resources**, such as **virtual power plants and EV charging stations**.

## 🚀 Features
- 🌐 **Interactive 3D Globe** – Built using `globe.gl` and `Three.js`
- ⚡ **Energy Infrastructure Overlay** – (Upcoming) Virtual power plants, EV stations
- 🗺️ **Mapbox Integration** – Satellite imagery for real-world visuals
- 📡 **Dynamic Demand Response Data** – (Upcoming) Real-time grid flexibility visualization
